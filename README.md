# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This is a project for the Udacity Nanodegree on Web Development Professional Track.

## Objective
The objective is to create a webpage that uses an external API to show the weather for a city that the user inputs the Zip-code for.

Data is sent to a local server created using Node.js and then forwarded to the 'app.js' file to be shown on the webpage.
